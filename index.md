# Welcome!

Hello there! I'm a Researcher/ML Engineer currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. I'm interested in the following areas
- Developing scalable, intelligent, and safe multi-agent systems.
- Automating research processes.
- AI safety and alignment.

Before Queen Mary, I completed an MSci in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London (UCL) and a BSc in Mathematics at the University of Bristol.

Professionally, I have experience in developing and deploying machine learning models and back-end systems for various start-ups. I have led projects from proof of concept to production, ensuring robust and scalable solutions. In my previous life I worked as a software engineer developing fully automated end-to-end data management solutions.
