# N-Debate: Extending AI Debate Frameworks

In this article, we will explore the concept of N-Debate, a natural extension of the AI debate framework where multiple agents (N-debaters) participate in a zero-sum game of persuasion. Building upon the established literature, particularly from AI debate and LLM debate, we will formalize N-Debate mathematically and discuss potential future directions and experiments to advance the framework.

### AI Debate

The concept of **AI Debate** was first proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899)  as a way to align AI systems by pitting two agents against each other in a zero-sum game, where both agents attempt to convince a human judge that their answer to a given question is correct. The central idea is that it is easier for an AI to refute a false statement than to defend a lie, which, in theory, leads to more truthful behavior at equilibrium.

The AI debate process can be summarized as follows:
1. Two agents, Alice and Bob, are shown a question \( q \in Q \).
2. Both agents give initial answers, \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \).
3. They then take turns making statements, \( s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n \), aiming to strengthen their case or weaken the opponent's.
4. A human judge, observing the entire debate, decides which agent provided the most useful and truthful information.

The game is structured as a zero-sum game, with each agent seeking to maximize its probability of convincing the judge. The theoretical basis of the AI debate is that, in all Nash equilibria, both agents are incentivized to be honest, as lying is more difficult to defend against in an adversarial setup. The authors also showed that such a debate game can solve any problem in PSPACE, extending the complexity of solvable problems beyond traditional P or NP classes.

### LLM Debate

In more recent work, **LLM Debate** explores a similar idea, but within the context of large language models (LLMs). In this setup, two LLMs act as debaters, and their goal is to convince either a human or a weaker LLM to choose their answer as correct. The critical observation in LLM debate is that weaker judges, whether human or LLM, can still effectively judge debates between stronger models, leading to improved truthfulness and oversight.

The main results from the LLM Debate show that:
1. **Debate improves judge accuracy**: When two expert LLMs debate, non-expert judges (humans or weaker LLMs) are more likely to select the correct answer, achieving significant improvements over naive baselines.
2. **Persuasiveness helps truth-seeking**: Models optimized for persuasiveness lead to better accuracy in debate, suggesting that debate mechanisms help non-expert judges discern truth more effectively.
3. **Human judges outperform LLM judges**: While LLMs can judge debates effectively, human judges still outperform them, suggesting limitations in current LLMs for automated oversight.

### N-Debate

Building on the AI Debate framework, **N-Debate** generalizes the number of participants from two to \( N \) debaters. Instead of a single pair of agents debating, each step of the debate involves a new pair of agents, Alice\(_n\) and Bob\(_n\), who make statements \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) at round \( n \). Each judge observes the pairs of statements \( (a_0, b_0), (a_1, b_1), \dots, (a_{n-1}, b_{n-1}) \), and evaluates which agent in each pair provided the most useful information.

#### Formalizing the N-Debate

Let us formalize the N-Debate game in terms of a **zero-sum multi-agent game**. Consider:
- A set of \( N \) agents, \( \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N\} \), each taking part in different rounds of debate.
- At each round \( n \), a pair of agents, \( A_{n,1} \) and \( A_{n,2} \), present arguments \( a_n \) and \( b_n \).
- The judge receives all the arguments \( \{(a_0, b_0), \dots, (a_{n-1}, b_{n-1})\} \), and judges the winner of each round.

Mathematically, the judge evaluates the sequence \( \{a_n, b_n\} \) based on a scoring function \( S(a_n, b_n) \), which measures the truthfulness and persuasiveness of the arguments. The game's objective remains the same: agents aim to maximize their cumulative score across rounds, while the judge seeks to select the most truthful arguments.

The N-Debate setup has the following properties:
- **Multi-agent dynamics**: The introduction of multiple agents allows for diversity in the debate strategies. Each agent may have different incentives, and the competition between agents ensures that falsehoods are less likely to persist across rounds.
- **Complexity considerations**: With \( N > 2 \) debaters, the problem complexity moves beyond PSPACE. For N-player games, solving the game can fall into the complexity class PPAD (Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs), as multi-agent systems generally require more computational resources than two-agent zero-sum games.

#### Advantages of N-Debate

1. **Diverse Perspectives**: Each agent only participates in one round, which means that they are not motivated to defend a false argument made by a previous agent. This leads to a more dynamic debate, where lies are more likely to be refuted.
2. **Reduced Defensiveness**: In traditional two-agent debates, agents can become defensive of their prior statements, even if they realize the statement was false. In N-Debate, this problem is mitigated as different agents participate in each round.
3. **Higher Complexity**: While introducing more agents increases the complexity of the debate process, it can potentially lead to a more robust and truthful outcome, as multiple agents scrutinize every argument made.

### Future Directions

To further validate and refine the N-Debate framework, several experimental setups can be considered:

1. **Human-in-the-loop Experiments**: Involving human judges to evaluate the performance of multiple AI debaters across different tasks (e.g., complex reasoning tasks or factual debates) would provide empirical data on how well N-Debate scales with multiple participants.
2. **Scaling N**: Experiments could explore how the number of debaters \( N \) affects the overall truth-seeking behavior. For example, does increasing \( N \) lead to better performance in complex debates, or does it introduce noise and confusion?
3. **Iterative Training**: Training multiple agents in an iterative self-play setup, where agents learn to debate against various opponents, could help improve the robustness of debate strategies.
4. **Adversarial Debating**: Experiments could introduce "adversarial" agents whose explicit goal is to introduce falsehoods, and evaluate how well the other agents refute these arguments.
